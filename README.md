> **Hey!** I am Diego Alba.

I am traditionally an IT and Cybersecurity Professional, but at heart, I am a software engineer. After taking my first Operating System's Design class, I went all-in and am the maintainer for the [Moj-OS Kernel, Kernel-01A](https://github.com/Mojave-OS/Kernel-01A). 

Moj-OS is actively being developed and still in it's infancy! Check it out.
